## Sample Chapter: Kill Budgets, Not Dreams

Budgets are bullshit. They're some guess about optimal pricing that turns into gospel. Instead of budgets, find the real cost of things.

When we were doing photoshoots with photographers, our goal was to shoot three scenes: office, home, and pajamas. We went to Zara and purchased the clothing for it. No budget would do the trick - we just got what we needed and figured out the real price.

The budget mindset makes you lazy. "We have $5,000 for this" becomes an excuse to not shop around, not negotiate, not think. Kill that. Demand good prices from the market instead.

## Sample Chapter: The Screenshot Tool  

I require people to have a process, not specific results. This way, I don't have to always define new results and try to guess the next objective, which is irritating and hard for them. Instead, I trust them.

They work well if I give them a tracking tool like Hubstaff with screenshots. I know they're not watching YouTube or working for someone else. It's about focus on process, not micromanaging.

Some people think this is controversial. But it works. I focus on results through process, instead of constantly defining new objectives.

## Sample Chapter: Fire the "My Life Sucks" People

There are several levels of culture: "My life sucks," "I'm great and you're not," and "We are great." 

"We are great" is good culture for a startup. "We are changing the world" is even better. But you should fire people from the "My life sucks" level because they're toxic to the team.

You can feel the difference when someone quits. In good culture, people are proud of their work. In bad culture, they fantasize about revenge.

## Sample Chapter: Freemium is a Pleasure

Freemium is something people share. If it's a free product, lean toward the free side. If you create a paid product nobody uses, that's a failure. If you create a freemium product that everybody's using and it's viral - that's pleasure.

You can add paywalls wherever you want later. It's much easier to monetize something people already love than to force people to pay for something they haven't tried.

We had one product reach millions of users with zero ad spend. When we added premium features, people converted because they already saw the value.

## Sample Chapter: Think About the Evil Side

If you want a viral product, think about the evil side of it, not only the good side. The good side is possible, but it's 100 times harder.

When we created the face generation tool, it went viral. I was interviewed by Washington Post and BBC. They all had the same story in mind: how horrible this technology is and how to save families from it.

That's fine. Negative press is still press. The controversy made it spread faster than any marketing budget could.

## Sample Chapter: Always Shopping for Prices

Cherry-picking offers is an art. We got $100K worth of GPU compute for $10K per year just by shopping cloud credits, trials, and beta access. Same approach works for office space, software, everything.

Most people are lazy about this. They see a price and accept it. But every price is negotiable, every service has competitors, every vendor has promotions.

Do it while it's worth your money. If you can get $1K by asking a simple question that takes you 3 minutes, that's $20K per hour! In contrast, getting $2 discount for the same time probably is not worth it.

The key is making it systematic. Always be shopping, always be comparing. Turn deal-hunting into a process, not a one-time thing.
