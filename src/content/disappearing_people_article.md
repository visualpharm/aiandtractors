# The Great Vanishing: How Businesses Erased Humans from Their Visual Identity

**TL;DR:** Icons8's research shows that in the last six months, people have disappeared from corporate imagery, replaced by AI and robots. Companies no longer want to appear as "people companies"—being an AI company is everything now.

## Our Business: Visualizing Corporate Identity

For over 20 years, Icons8 has served businesses by creating graphics that visualize how they want to be seen. Our clients are businesses, and they buy pictures of how they want to be portrayed. One thing remained constant throughout these years: businesses valued teamwork and wanted to appear as cohesive teams of professionals with great culture and shared success.

## Our Analytics: Tracking Business Tastes at Scale

As a company with dozens of in-house artists, we dedicate vast resources to analyze business tastes. We use comprehensive analytics for that—download counts, search patterns, and usage metrics. We track the leaders of downloads and understand how business preferences evolve. For years, the leaders were human-centered: teams collaborating, diverse groups working together, professionals engaging face-to-face. The world we visualized was alive, bustling with human activity.

## The Great Vanishing

But our constant research reveals something apocalyptic has happened in the last six months. The numbers are stark: people imagery in our 3D illustration pack dropped 87.5%—from 8 human-centered illustrations to just 1. The most striking example are our [3D modeled illustrations](https://icons8.com/illustrations/style--3d-hygge):

**People disappeared.** But it's worse than disappearing—they became fragments. Human representation is often reduced to floating hands holding objects—a phone, a cup, making an OK sign. Humans became disembodied appendages to their devices. It's like a post-apocalypse where humanity was reduced to body parts interfacing with technology operating on its own.

Our other illustration pack confirms the trend. In our people vs robots comparison, people decreased from 28+ to 17, while robots increased from 3 to 12—a 4x jump. While human activities became more diverse, the overall shift moved toward technology-centric rather than human-centric representations.

Our overall leaders, heavily dominated by icons, show the same trend. People almost completely disappeared. Teamwork disappeared. We have more robots than people. We have multiple representations of AI instead: spheres, robots, sparkles.

*Now: only 2 illustrations of people made it. People are dominated not only by robots, but by AI-representing spheres too*

What we see now is a dramatic shift where agentic AI takes the place of people. But there's a fascinating inversion: as robots gained expressive blue eyes and emotional design language, humans lost their faces entirely. AI evolved from abstract geometric shapes to beings with distinct personalities, while humans devolved from collaborative teams to faceless fragments.

## The New Reality

Being a people company is not cool anymore. Being an AI company is everything. Agentic AI takes the place of people. The shareholder value lies in this transformation.

Perhaps we're witnessing the most honest corporate communication in decades. This shift doesn't just correspond to Robotaxi, future Robotaxi farms, and drone delivery startups, but the broadest range of businesses. For the first time, companies are showing us exactly how they see the future of work: a world where humans are optional.
